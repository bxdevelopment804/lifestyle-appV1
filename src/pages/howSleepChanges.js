				According to MedlinePlus, a service of the National Library of Medicine,
				many people experience more difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep
				as they get older, and they wake up earlier in the morning. Overall
				sleep time may decrease, even if time in bed does not.
			</p>
			<p className='articleDescription'>
				There’s a reason for this. According to the National Sleep Foundation,
				the body’s circadian rhythm experiences a “phase advance,” where it
				shifts forward in time with age. This phase advance is usually
				experienced as getting tired earlier in the day and waking up earlier in
				the morning. It also means older adults typically spend more time in the
				earlier, lighter stages of sleep and achieve less deep sleep throughout
				the night.
			</p>
			<p className='articleDescription'>
				But even though older people may be getting less sleep, it’s not because
				they’re wired to function on less. Older adults require the same amount
				of sleep as younger adults: roughly 7–9 hours each night.
			</p>

				In your 20s, you are more likely to be a night owl, preferring the
				evening hours over early mornings. You may even struggle to function
				early in the morning, which is a carryover from the post-puberty
				adolescent years. When you’re young, you can get away with less sleep,
				but this changes as the years go by, with more people developing a
				fondness for turning in early by the time they reach 30. Unfortunately,
				that’s about when total sleep time begins to decrease for most adults.
			</p>
			<p className='articleDescription'>
				Our 30s and 40s are often characterized by more demanding jobs, family
				lives and stress. We tend to fall into longer lifestyle patterns during
				these decades, too, with more structured routines. When those routines
				don’t prioritize sleep or allow for enough rest each night, it’s
				difficult to break those habits.
			</p>
			<p className='articleDescription'>
				Studies have shown the total amount of sleep decreases linearly with
				age, with an average loss of 10 minutes per decade. Interestingly, how
				we sleep also changes. The percentage of deep sleep we get each night
				decreases linearly at 2% per decade until about age 60. In your 60s and
				beyond, these losses plateau.
			</p>
			<p className='articleDescription'>
				Sleep issues present themselves by gender in slightly different ways. A
				meta-analysis of 65 studies found women are more likely to have
				difficulty falling asleep as they age, but men are more likely to
				experience shorter total sleep time and to wake up more often during the
				night.
			</p>
			<p className='articleDescription'>
				All that can seem a bit depressing, but there is still hope for a
				restful night’s sleep. General wellness and sleep hygiene practices
				apply, no matter your age. Avoiding late meals, limiting screen time and
				winding down before bed can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy more
				restful slumber. Considering that sleep is so vital to overall health,
				making these little adjustments is worth the effort.
